# Support

Smart-Context purely based on React. There are no customizations or overrides which makes it maintenance free.

It is designed to evolve gracefully with React and only becomes better with each React update.

Got some suggestions? PRs are welcome or [create issue](https://github.com/achaljain/smart-context/issues).
